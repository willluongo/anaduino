anaduino
========

This is the repository for the Arduino code [Ana](https://github.com/poquitofry "poquitofry") and [I](https://github.com/willluongo "willluongo") write together. Maybe if we do a particularly cool physical project we will put the schematic in here as well. 

Please excuse the odd project structure, it allows the projects to be compiled/uploaded using [ino](https://github.com/amperka/ino "ino tool") or the [original Arduino IDE](http://arduino.cc/en/main/software "Arduino IDE") without modifying the source further.
